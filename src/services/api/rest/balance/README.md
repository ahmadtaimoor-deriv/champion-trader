# Balance Service Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Balance Service which is responsible for fetching and updating user balance data through REST API calls.

## Overview
The Balance Service interacts with the backend to retrieve the user's balance information and perform necessary updates. It is designed to work seamlessly with the application's state management (via clientStore) and integrates with other components such as BalanceDisplay and BalanceHandler.

## Features
- Retrieves balance data from a designated backend endpoint.
- Supports updating balance data when transactions occur.
- Implements error handling and retry logic for robust operation.
- Provides TypeScript type safety for request parameters and responses.
- Leverages TDD practices for maintainability and scalability.

## API Endpoints
- **GET /balance**: Fetches the current balance data for the logged-in user.
- **PUT /balance**: Updates the balance data following a transaction or user action.

## Request/Response Formats

### Get Balance Request
- **Method**: GET
- **Endpoint**: `/balance`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "balance": 1000,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
  ```

### Update Balance Request
- **Method**: PUT
- **Endpoint**: `/balance`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "balance": 1200
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "balance": 1200,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
  ```

## Error Handling
- Network or server errors are captured and logged.
- The service implements retries with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Proper error messages are returned in case of validation errors or failed updates.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { fetchBalance, updateBalance } from '@/services/api/rest/balance/service';

async function loadBalance() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchBalance();
    console.log('Current balance:', data.balance);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching balance:', error);
  }
}

async function changeBalance(newBalance: number) {
  try {
    const data = await updateBalance({ balance: newBalance });
    console.log('Updated balance:', data.balance);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating balance:', error);
  }
}
```

## Integration Notes
- Ensure that the API base URL and endpoints are correctly configured in the main configuration file ([src/config/api.ts](../../config/api.ts)).
- The balance service plays a critical role in financial transactions; hence, rigorous testing (unit and integration tests) is mandatory.
- This service is usually invoked by components such as BalanceDisplay and BalanceHandler to maintain synchronization between the UI and backend data.
