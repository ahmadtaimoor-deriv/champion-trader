# BalanceHandler Component

The BalanceHandler component is responsible for managing and updating the user's balance data, ensuring that balance information is accurately refreshed and maintained across the application.

## Features
- Fetches and updates balance data from the backend or clientStore.
- Handles state management and error states related to balance updates.
- Integrates seamlessly with other components such as BalanceDisplay.
- Designed following atomic component and TDD principles.

## Props
- **onUpdate**: *function* (optional) — Callback function triggered when a balance update occurs.
- **initialBalance**: *number* (optional) — Sets an initial balance value, if applicable.

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { BalanceHandler } from '@/components/BalanceHandler';

function App() {
  const handleBalanceUpdate = (newBalance: number) => {
    console.log('Updated balance:', newBalance);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <BalanceHandler 
        onUpdate={handleBalanceUpdate}
        initialBalance={1000}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Testing
